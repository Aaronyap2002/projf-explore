# Project F: Exploring FPGAs

This repository contains the Verilog designs to accompany the Project F [Exploring FPGAs](https://projectf.io/tags/explore/) series. All the designs are under the permissive [MIT licence](LICENSE), but the blog posts themselves are subject to normal copyright restrictions.

## FPGA Graphics

In this series we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. We start by learning how displays work, before racing the beam with Pong, drawing starfields and sprites, simulating life with bitmaps, drawing lines and triangles, and finally creating simple 3D models.
