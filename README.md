# Project F: Exploring FPGAs

This repository contains the SystemVerilog designs to accompany the Project F [Exploring FPGAs](https://projectf.io/tags/explore/) series. All the designs are under the permissive [MIT licence](LICENSE), but the blog posts themselves are subject to normal copyright restrictions.

## FPGA Graphics

In this series, we'll be exploring FPGA graphics of all kinds, from a static square, through Pong and the Mandelbrot set, to bitmaps, text scrollers, and even 3D modelling.
